#### 3. Navigate into root directory of repository you just cloned
```
cd MERL-Center-public
```

#### 4. Check if you have Ruby installed locally. If you don't have Ruby installed, follow the instructions [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to install Ruby
```
ruby -v
```
#### 5. Install the bundler gem with this command
```
gem install bundler
```

#### 6. Install dependencies from Gemfile with this command
```
bundle install
```
#### 7. Check if you have npm installed. If you don't have npm installed, download node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
```
npm -v
```
#### 8. Run the start script from our package.json
```
npm run start
```
#### 9. Navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to see the site running locally 

#### 10. Add a remote called `upstream` to your local repository that points to the main repository
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MERLTech/MERL-Center-public.git
```
Verify that the origin remote points to your fork and the upstream remote points to the main repository
```
git remote -v
```

#### 11. Add fetch configuration to simplify pulling down branch data for pull request reviews
```
git config --add remote.upstream.fetch "+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*"
```
This command adds additional fetch instructions to your `.git/config` file so that you can more easily pull down branches from pull requests on the upstream repository


## Review A Pull Request
#### 1. Add yourself as a reviewer of the pull request on Github

#### 2. Make sure you are on the main branch of your local repository
``` 
git switch main
```
#### 3. Pull down latest changes from main branch of upstream repository
```
git pull upstream main
```
#### 4. Fetch all pull request data from the upstream repository using the upstream remote that was modified in step 11 of setting up your local dev environment
```
git fetch upstream
```
#### 5. Checkout the specific pull request you want to review
```
git checkout upstream/pr/<number>
```

#### 6. Run the start script from our package.json
```
npm run start
```
#### 7. Navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to check if the changes from the pull request are working as expected

#### 8. Go back to github and find the "Files Changed" tab of the pull request to submit feedback

You have three options for submitting feedback:
<br>
- Leave a comment on the pull request
- Approve the pull request which will allow for merging
- Request changes which will prevent pull request from being merged until changes are made and you re-review the pull request



## Create A Pull Request
#### 1. Switch to the main branch
```
git switch main
```
#### 2. Pull down latest changes from main branch of upstream repository
```
git pull upstream main
```

#### 3. Create a new branch for each issue you work on
```
git checkout -b <relevant-branch-name>
```

#### 4. Verify that you are on your newly created branch from step 3 and NOT on the main branch
```
git branch
```

#### 5. Make necessary changes to code in order to satisfy the requirements of the issue you are working on

#### 6. Add the changes to staging area
```
git add .
```
#### 7. Commit the changes to your local repository
```
git commit -m "short descriptive commit message"
```
#### 8. Push the changes to your forked repository using the `origin` remote
```
git push --set-upstream origin <relevant-branch-name>
```
Note: replace `<relevent-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created in step 3

#### 9. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button
