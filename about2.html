        <div class="rte">
          <p>MERL Center members collaborate on GitHub repositories and Google Workspace to create case studies and guides to help (non-software developer) MERL practitioners understand if, how, and when to use open source solutions. In February 2022, the MERL Center expanded its scope! In addition to our focus on MERL and open source, we are now exploring topics on MERL and data science, and MERL and human-centered design.</p> 
          <p>Click to see our definitions of <a href="https://github.com/merlcenter/MERL-Center-public/blob/main/MERLdefinition.md" target="_blank">MERL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/merlcenter/MERL-Center-public/blob/main/data-science-definition.md" target="_blank">data science</a> and <a href="https://github.com/merlcenter/MERL-Center-public/blob/main/human-centered-design-definition.md" target="_blank">human-centered design</a>.</p>
         <p>Case studies go in depth on specific examples of using open source solutions, data science or human-centered design for MERL purposes, or MERL aspects of these disciplines. Guides discuss major topics at the intersection of MERL and open source, data science, or human-centered design. To date, MERL Center content has been text and picture based. Future MERL Center content may include code (scripts, software), data, and mathematical models. More information on how MERL Center members collaborate can be found <a href="https://socialimpact.github.com/insights/collaboration-power-merl-center/" target="_blank">in this blog post</a>.</p>
