# MERL Center Editorial Guidelines

This is the editorial style guideline for all content the MERL Center produces. The goal of this file is to create consistency among contributions of different authors. It is not meant to be authoritative or erase an individual author's voice! Read more about t[ypes of MERL Center contributions here](https://github.com/merlcenter/merl-center/blob/main/Contribute/contributing-ReadMe.md).

Note that any content created for the MERL Center must abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/merlcenter/merl-center/blob/main/Contribute/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Text

### Voice, tone and style

- Language should be clear, professional, and jargon-free (or jargon-defined). 
- Avoid using flowery language e.g. endless adjectives
- Use narrative non-fiction to engage readers or emphasize a point. Avoid using narrative fiction.
- **Case studies** -  use a persuasive voice to convince the reader of an argument. Be clear if an argument is based in opinion or fact, or quantitative or qualitative data. 
- **Beginner's Guides** - present a balanced view of options, research, tools, etc. For example, present pros/cons of tools instead of advocating for a tool without context.
- Use third person, present tense wherever possible. Case studies may be best written in first person.

### Length

There is no specific length requirement. Break up long pieces with sections. Ensure content is as succinct as possible, avoids repetition and when possible, is modular i.e. can read as standalone text.

## Images

### Color, Fonts

| Color   | Hex       | Fill         | Hex       |
| ------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Color 1 | Hex value | Color fill 1 | Hex value |


### Titles and Labels

- Adding titles directly to pictures is optional. Add picture titles in the content markdown file on the public repo.
- Add titles for all graphs and charts - while the author may repeat the title in the content markdown file, having a title directly in graphs and charts will help if the image is shared on its own.
- Clearly label all axes on graphs and charts. Include keys where necessary

### Size and Dimensions

- The maximum width of an image is 900 px
- There is no maximum height
- There are no minimum heights or widths. Authors should test image resolution on different devices.

### Formats
The following extensions are supported: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tiff, or .gif
