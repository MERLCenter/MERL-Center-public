### The MERL Center is a website to help monitoring, evaluation, research and learning (MERL) practitioners understand if, how and when to use open source software, data and tools as part of their MERL solutions

#### Founded in September 2019 by the Tech for Social Good program of [GitHub Social Impact](https://socialimpact.github.com) and [Kurante/MERL Tech](http://merltech.org), the MERL Center materials are conceptualized, produced, edited and open sourced by dedicated, cross-disciplinary working groups.
